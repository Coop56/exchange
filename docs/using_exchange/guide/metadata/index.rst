Working with Metadata
=====================

In Exchange, metadata can easily be edited for all layers, maps and documents. Keeping metadata current and thorough is important in maintaining data relevance, quality and accuracy. The more information provided in the metadata section, the more other users will understand the value of the dataset.

As you learned in Working with Layers, some metadata is added when :ref:`importing <uploadlayers>` a layer. The basics, such as the title, abstract and category are add by the user, while information such as the projection system, bounding box coordinates, and reference links are automatically created by Exchange, and are unable to be edited by users. Additional information is added through editing the metadata.
