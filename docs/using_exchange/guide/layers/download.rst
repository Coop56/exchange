Within Exchange, there are two ways to extract data and metadata, download a layer or download a layer’s metadata. This facilitates the flow of geospatial data in (import) and out (export) of Exchange.

Download data

1. Click the :guilabel:`Download Layer` button.

2. Select the format in which you’d like the data to be downloaded. Exchange currently offers the following formats for use in multiple geospatial platforms:
