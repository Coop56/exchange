Additional Map Features
=======================

Search for locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find a specific location on the map simply by typing the name of a place, zip code, address or lat/long (DMS or DD) in the Search Locations textbox. Click the search button to return a list of possible matches. Scroll through the list, and select one of the matches. The map will recenter on that location. This is a simple search, and does not allow wildcards.

Create a copy of a map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use an existing map as a starting point for another map. This allows you to incorporate the work others have done without changing their maps.

1. Click **Maps** on the  Boundless Exchange toolbar, and select Explore Maps in the drop-down menu.

2. Select on the map you would like to copy. This will open the map details page.

3. Click the :guilabel:`Create a New Map` button under the Copy this map section.

   .. figure:: img/copy-map.png

A new map will open, populated with all of the layers of the map you copied.

4. Click the :guilabel:`Save this map` button on the toolbar.

5. Add a new title and an abstract, possibly indicating this is a copy of another map.

6. Click the :guilabel:`Save Copy` button.

Your new map is now saved, and can be accessed from the maps page.

.. important:: You are only copying the map. Any changes you make to the layer (data set) will affect any maps using that layer. Copying the map would primarily be used to make visual changes. To make changes to the data, it is recommended that you download the layer, and import your own copy.
