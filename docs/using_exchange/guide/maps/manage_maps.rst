Manage Maps
===========

Every map has its own details page, which provides more information about the map, the metadata and who has what permissions for making edits.

Click the **View Details** link to open the details page.

Edit map metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata plays an important role for maps. It describes the map in a way that the legend does not; why it was created, the date it was published, and who created it, for example. When a map is updated, it is important to update the metadata, as well.

**Note:** You can only edit the metadata for the map if you have the proper permissions.

1. Click the :guilabel:`Edit Map` button.

2. Click the :guilabel:`Edit` button under Metadata on the Edit Map menu.

3. In the metadata page, fill in the fields with information about the map. The more information you provide, the better others will understand your map.

**Note:** The “Category” field is a mandatory field, and if it has not previously been selected, you will be required to select one at that time.

4. Click the :guilabel:`Update` button to save your changes.

Set map thumbnail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default the thumbnail images for maps will only have the vector layers. In order to include the background map you will need to use the Set Map Thumbnail button.

1. Pan and/or zoom the inset map on the **Map Details** page so that it’s centered on the view you would like for the map thumbnail.

2. Click the :guilabel:`Edit Map` button.

3. Click the :guilabel:`Set` button under Thumbnail on the Edit Map menu.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Change Permissions of this Map` button in the Permissions section.
