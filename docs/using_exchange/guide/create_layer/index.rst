Create a New Layer
==================

Creating a new, blank layer allows users the freedom to build a layer with the attribute data they need, and still be able to tailor the style to what they want. Exchange users can create new, blank layers, rather than be limited to data that must be uploaded. From there, a user can add points, lines or polygons as necessary. The layer can be styled as explained in the :ref:`Styling Layers <styling>` section.

Creating a new layer in Exchange allows users of the `Boundless Anywhereâ„¢ <https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/docs/anywhere/1.3.0/>`_ app to create a framework for their data, and use it to add features while out in the field.

Please email contact@boundlessgeo.com for more information on how to get Boundless Anywhere for mobile field data collection.
