Manage Remote Services
======================

Edit Service Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata provides the user with more information about the dataset. The more information made available, the better understanding the user will have of the data.

1. From the information page of the service, click the :guilabel:`Edit Service Metadata` button.

2. Provide as much information as possible. Several of the fields are mandatory, and require your response.

  * **Classification/Caveat** - If your data has a classification, it may be required for that to be populated according to your standard operating procedures.

  * **Title** - It may be helpful to edit the title of the layer, as many of the services import with very generic titles.

  * **Category** - Select a corresponding category to your data.

  * **License** - If your data does not have any associated licenses, select Public Domain from the list.

  * **Provenance** - Indicates the producer of the data content.

  * **Fees** - If there are no fees associated to your data, type “none.”

Servcie updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select the :guilabel:`Scan Service for Resources` button to check for updated or additional resources to the service.

Any new services will be added to the list.

Remove a service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a service is no longer needed, or the information becomes obsolete, an administrator can easily remove it from Exchange.

1. From the information page of the service, click the :guilabel:`Manage Services` button, and select **Remove Service** from the list.

2. Click the :guilabel:`Yes, I am sure` button to verify your selection.

Access service URLs within Exchange
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All Exchange layers have service endpoints available to users from the search results list. Users can access the URLs, which can then be used in other programs such as ArcGIS or QGIS.

1. Click the link under the layer description to copy the URL to the clipboard.

2. Paste the URL where required to register the service.
