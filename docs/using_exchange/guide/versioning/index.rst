==================

GeoGig is a specialized database that was designed for distributed editing, and supports collaborative editing of geospatial data. It is designed for vector data (point, line, polygon, etc.), and is recommended as the best way to maintain a reliable history of changes to your data.

When a layer has been stored in GeoGig, it maintains the history of all of the edits made to the data, along with who made the changes and when. Within the web map, you can view the history for a layer and for the features.
