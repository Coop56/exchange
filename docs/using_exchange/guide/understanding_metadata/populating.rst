Populating Metadata
===================

When you import content into Exchange, there is a certain amount of metadata that is added to the dataset by default. The type of data, content owner, spatial identification, and references will be created automatically, and the remainder is done later (please see section on Working with Metadata for more details). It is up to all users to ensure the metadata is as robust and accurate as possible.
