Layers
======

The Layers section of the Django administration site is used to maintain features for a layer. The primary function used in this section is the ability to edit individual attributes for a layer. The other options in the Layers section are not covered in this documentation.

2. Find the layer whose attributes you’d like to edit. You can do this multiple ways:

  * Type all or part of the layer name in the search field at the top of the page.
  * Select a filter term on the right side of the page to minimize layer results.
  * Scroll through the list of results.
