Audit Trail
===========

The audit trail is intended to display all of the activities that happen within Exchange. It tracks who performed what actions, and when. Included is detailed information about the user, such as their IP, email address, full name and their user status.

To view the audit trail, click Audit events in the Audit trail menu on the Django site administration page.

A list of all of the events that have occurred within Exchange will display. From here, administrators can filter everything for specific types of events, users, etc. using the search field. Simply type a term in the textbox, and click the Search button.

Audit trail is very similar to the Activity stream feature, but the primary difference is that with Audit trail, you are able to see when an event occurred, and from where. Activity stream tells you exactly what action has taken place.
